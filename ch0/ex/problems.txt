1. This statement adds 3 + 4 but then discards the results at the semicolon and it has no side effects.

3. It seems to produce 4 spaces

5. This is not a valid program. The main function is malformed it needs {}

6. Interestingly yes this is valid. It seems an statement or block can be wrapped in {} an arbitrary number of times.

7. No, what happens is the multiline comment ends itself too early leaving the rest of the comment hanging as "real" code that is invalid.

8. Interestingly this also seems to be valid. Since the start of the "multi" comment is in a comment it is ignored and so of course the closing one is as well.

9. int main(){}
