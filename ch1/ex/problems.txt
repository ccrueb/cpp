1. Yes these two statements follow the rules.

2. Yes these two statements follow the rules.

3. This is vaid
  > a string
  > another string

4. No we are trying to declare the string 's' twice in the same scope. Changing the braces shouldn't matter.

INCORRECT. Nested scope allows you to redefine variable names from a parent scope

5. No x is out of scope

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "a string";
    std::string x = s + ", really?";
    std::cout << s << std::endl;
    std::cout << x << std::endl;

    return 0; 
} 

6. It splits the name into two since cin reads until whitespace.
